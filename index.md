# Survive the China Flu!

PREPARE NOW. Many emergency supplies are already severely depleted or gone. Do not believe the misinformation that other viruses (like the flu) are more dangerous and that there is no reason to be afraid. Remember when just a few weeks ago you were being told there was absolutely no concern whatsoever?

## Survival Time:

Remember, you can only survive:
* 3 weeks without food
* 3 days without water
* 3 hours without shelter
* 3 minutes without oxygen
* 3 seconds without a plan

# Essentials

## Water

Store one gallon of clean water per person, per day. This might sound like a lot, but one gallon per day is for drinking, rehydrating food, cleaning, hygiene, etc., and goes more quickly than you think.

Store as many gallons as you can (AT LEAST a week's worth per person). Buying commercially sealed bottled water is the easiest option, but it is more economical to sterilize and store your own water. The "WaterBrick" and the "WaterBOB" are two good options for storing water.

### Sterilizing Water

Wash your food-safe water container with dish soap and water and rinse thoroughly. Sterilize the container with a slightly diluted bleach blend (ex, 1/2 cup of bleach + 1 cup of water) and rinse thoroughly. Fill with clean water, and add 8 drops of 6% bleach per gallon or 6 drops of 8% bleach per gallon to make the water sterile and drinkable for years. (Wait at least 30 minutes before drinking. Be sure to use unscented regular bleach without additives.)

## Food

Store 1200-2000 Calories worth of food per person, per day. Emergency food supplies, MREs, and freeze dried food are all excellent options. They are also mostly depleted by this point. Supplement with economical, shelf-stable goods like dried beans and rice, flour, etc. Consider buying from stores like Costco or commercial food suppliers (GFS, etc.). If you are depending on canned food, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CAN OPENER.

## Vitamins

Have multivitamins on hand, and iodized salt to add to food. Electrolyte drink powder and/or electrolyte-rich drinks are helpful as well.

## Medicines and Medications

Store an excess of any important medications and medicines. Many of these are manufactured in China, and will run out.
