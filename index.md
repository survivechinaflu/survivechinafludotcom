# Survive COVID-19, the China Flu!

## This website is regularly being updated. Check back frequently. Share it with your family and friends.

PREPARE NOW. Many emergency supplies are already severely depleted or gone. Do not believe the misinformation that other viruses (like the flu) are more dangerous and that there is no reason to be afraid. Remember when just a few weeks ago you were being told there was absolutely no concern whatsoever?

## Survival Time:

Remember, you can only survive:
* 3 weeks without food
* 3 days without water
* 3 hours without shelter
* 3 minutes without oxygen
* 3 seconds without a plan

# Prevention

## STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE! WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER YOU ðŸ’©! STOP TOUCHING ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING!

Other humans are your greatest risk. Get ready to avoid them for a while (like a month or more). For now, don't travel. Don't go to big events. Don't hang out in crowds. Avoid other people and their disease whenever possible. When you have to interact with potential disease carriers, minimize that contact. Wash and sanitize your hands after being in public. Treat sick people like the plague they are. If you're sick, try not to make other people sick. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough/sneeze (with your ELBOW).

# Food and Water

## Water

Store one gallon of clean water per person, per day. This might sound like a lot, but one gallon per day is for drinking, rehydrating food, cleaning, hygiene, etc., and goes more quickly than you think.

Store as many gallons as you can (AT LEAST a week's worth per person). Buying commercially sealed bottled water is the easiest option, but it is more economical to sterilize and store your own water. The "WaterBrick" and the "WaterBOB" are two good options for storing water.

### Sterilizing Water

Wash your food-safe water container with dish soap and water and rinse thoroughly. Sterilize the container with a slightly diluted bleach blend (ex, 1/2 cup of bleach + 1 cup of water) and rinse thoroughly. Fill with clean water, and add 8 drops of 6% bleach per gallon or 6 drops of 8% bleach per gallon to make the water sterile and drinkable for years. (Wait at least 30 minutes before drinking. Be sure to use unscented regular bleach without additives.)

## Food

Store 1200-2000 Calories worth of food per person, per day. Emergency food supplies, MREs, and freeze dried food are all excellent options. They are also mostly depleted by this point. Supplement with economical, shelf-stable goods like dried beans and rice, flour, etc. Consider buying from stores like Costco or commercial food suppliers (GFS, etc.). If you are depending on canned food, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CAN OPENER.

## Vitamins

Water and food are not enough to stay nourished and healthy. Have multivitamins on hand, and iodized salt to add to food. Electrolyte drink powder and/or electrolyte-rich drinks are helpful as well.

# Medical Supplies and Cleanliness

## Medicines and Medications

Store an excess of any important medications and medicines. Many of these are manufactured in China, and will run out. Don't forget birth control, pain killers, allergy medications, etc.

## Hygiene

Poor hygiene can quickly be lethal. Store extra toilet paper, paper towels, and baby wipes, along with extra trash bags. Include feminine hygiene products if anyone depends on them, and any other specific hygiene products you need.

## Sanitation and Sterilization

Bleach is cheap and kills nearly everything. It can be used to sterilize things, sanitize water, etc. Have plenty of bleach on hand. Hand sanitizer (and the rubbing alcohol it contains) is also likely effective (and increasingly expensive and hard to find). Ozone (you can purchase ozone generators) and UV radiation (from sterilizing UV lights) are also likely to destroy the coronavirus, but are also dangerous to you (and anything alive) if misused.

Regular soap is important. Wash your hands!

# Power, Heat and Light

A generator is useful. A generator that can run on gasoline and propane is even better. Generators like to stay dry, and they require fuel, and they like to generate toxic gasses, so keep all that in mind.

Buy flashlights and candles. Lots.

Buy lots of batteries for stuff that needs batteries (like flashlights).

Consider having a cheap, simple way to heat water and cook, like a propane camping stove. You can buy an adapter hose to attach 20 lb propane tanks so you don't have to have a bunch of small propane tanks.

Fire generates heat and light. Having various ways to make fire (and extinguish it) is helpful. Remember that fire likes fuel. DO NOT START AN INDOOR FIRE OUTSIDE A FIREPLACE. YOU WILL DIE.

# Defense

Most people will not prepare. If you prepare, you become a target for other people. Be ready to do what needs to be done to protect your life and preps. Start with what is called first line gear. A quality belt, kydex holster, reliable pistol, flashlight, and knife. Carry an extra magazine incase the one in your gun fails.

The Beltman and Special Operation Equipment make excellent belts. 

Glock 19 is ubiquoitous around the globe and owned be civlians and militaries alike, so parts and magazines are plentiful. Many other options are available, keep in mind availability of parts, magazines, and accessories for your pistol of choice. 

Green Force Tactical and NSR Tactical make some of the best kydex holsters on the planet.

Surefire is about as robust as you can get for flashlights.

SpyderCo makes excellent pocket knives.

The next step, if you are willing to be around people, is to get training from proven schools such as Thunder Ranch and Tactical Response. Mindset, skills, and tactics are more important than gear but quality gear will help in the long run. Shooting at static targets at the indoor range and gun fighting are entirely different things.

A rifle isn't a bad option if you don't need to be covertly armed. Get an AR-15 or an AKM with as many magazines as you can afford. Your rifle will ideally also have a sling, weapon light, and RDS (Red Dot Sight)/LPVO(Low Power Variable Optic) on it.

# Pets

You probably want your fluffy companions to stay alive during and after this blows over, so be sure you set aside water, food, and any needed medical/other supplies for your pets, as well. Beyond companionship, which may be useful if you are socially isolated, our furry friends can be helpful to alert you to danger, scare off intruders, keep you warm, etc.
